# Signal-Processing-Projects
Welcome to my repository of signal processing projects. These projects explore Fourier analysis, STFT, chord identification, and audio signal manipulation using Python.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [STFT and Spectrogram Visualization](./STFT)
Analyze time-varying frequency content of audio signals using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Generates spectrograms to visualize how frequencies evolve over time.  
- Key features: Rectangular and Hann windows, log amplitude scaling, time-frequency mapping  
- Example file: `police.wav`  
- Example output: `image.png`

### 2. [Chord Identification](./Identify_Chords)
Identify the musical notes in `.wav` files by analyzing their frequency spectrum. Handles both long and short-duration chords using FFT and peak detection.  
- Key features: Zero-padding for short chords, frequency-to-note mapping, visual FFT plots  

### 3. [Echo Removal](./Echo_Removal)
Project focused on removing echoes from audio signals using convolution and deconvolution techniques.  
- Key features: Time-domain filtering, impulse response analysis
